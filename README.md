We present and evaluate the design of a new and
comprehensive solution for automated worm detection and immunization.
The system engages a peer-to-peer network of untrusted
machines on the Internet to detect new worms and facilitate rapid
preventative response. We evaluate the efficacy and scalability
of the proposed system through large-scale simulations and
assessments of a functional real-world prototype. We find that
the system enjoys scalability in terms of network coverage, faulttolerance,
security, and maintainability. It proves effective against
new worms, and supports collaboration among among mutually
mistrusting parties.
